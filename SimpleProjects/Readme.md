-You should write the name of the target website like this 🔗: https://www.website.com If you just provide it as "www.website.com", then you'll get an error.-

-I used the *Netsparker's wordlist(SVNDigger)*. You can use this wordlist or a related one. To download directly: https://www.netsparker.com/s/research/SVNDigger.zip This wordlist focuses on php related leftovers, so if you use my script, it is better to aim php backend, or use a related wordlist and give the path for that wordlist, so you can get a better security check on server. It is useful for some bugbounty related projects.-

**You need to provide the downloaded wordlist path. In the code I wrote, I assumed the path "desktop".**

# Project 4: Integrity Checker
### This script will calculate the hash of any file or folder with available algorithms such as MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc.
- Possible hashing algorithm supported: md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512, blake2b, blake2s, sha3_224, sha3_256, sha3_384, sha3_512, shake_128, shake_256
- *sha256* is the default. So You can press ENTER to skip choosing the alternative hashing algorithm
