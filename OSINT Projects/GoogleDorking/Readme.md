### EXAMPLE Google Dorks that you can use with this script:
````intitle:"Webcam" inurl:WebCam.htm````

- **If you need a worksheet related to Essay Writing, for example a Goole Search Operator example can be as follows:**
````inurl:itu.edu.tr filetype:pdf intitle:"Writing"````

### intitle:
The intitle operator is used to specify that the search results must contain a certain word or phrase in the title.

**Syntax:** intitle:keyword

### -site:
-site: operator is another operator in Google Dorking which is used to exclude results from a specific site or domain in your search. 
 The **-site**: operator can be used to exclude irrelevant or untrusted domains from search results, focusing the search on more reliable sources.

**Syntax:** keyword -site:example.com

**Syntax:** Info:example.com
This simple Google search operator will find the information related to a specific domain name.

### Output of a Google Dork search with this script: 
````inurl:zoom.us/j and intext:scheduled for````

### I have added some example Google Dorks in the script and in the terminal output when the code is run, it will show few of them to give you an idea. Also provided some good resource for Google dorks in the code by commenting out.
