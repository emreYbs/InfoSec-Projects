## I suggest to use Python Virtual Environment to test these simple projects. At least, it is the best practice and saves you lots of headache.
### It is always better to test on Python virtual environment, so use PyCharm (with Virtual Env.) or any editor by using the commands below to create a vritual environment:

*To create a virtual environment, Python supplies a built in venv module which provides the basic functionality needed for the virtual environment setup.*  </br>
_Running the command below will create a virtual environment named **"......"** inside the current folder you have selected in your terminal/command line:_ # 

_Example name for your own virt env_ 
 ````python -m venv .....````

**Once youâ€™ve created the virtual environment, you need to activate it.**
- *On Windows, run:*

`....-env\Scripts\activate`

- *On Unix or MacOS, run:*
`source .....-env/bin/activate`
