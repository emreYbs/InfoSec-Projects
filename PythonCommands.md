### It is always better to test on Python virtual environment, so use PyCharm (with Virtual Env.) or any editor by using the commands below to create a vritual environment:

*To create a virtual environment, Python supplies a built in venv module which provides the basic functionality needed for the virtual environment setup.*
_Running the command below will create a virtual environment named "......" inside the current folder you have selected in your terminal / command line:_ # Example name for your own virt env

python -m venv .....
Once you’ve created the virtual environment, you need to activate it. On Windows, run:

`....-env\Scripts\activate`

*On Unix or MacOS, run:*
`source .....-env/bin/activate`
